# Dynamic Form Builder Application

A coding challenge project built with Angular, featuring a dynamic form builder with permission controls and mock API interactions.

## üìñ Overview

This application allows users to create, manage, and fill dynamic forms with various input types. It supports role-based authorization, form validation, and submission to a mock API.  

This repository was created as a part of a coding challenge. If any requirement wasn't fully implemented due to time constraints, my approach and reasoning are documented below.
